NORMS:

What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?

---We will vote, and if there is a 50/50 split, get advice from our fellow

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.

--Have an open dialogue, if you're frusterated, tell the team and take a pause.
--Approach the person individually to discuss (potentially on Slack) first. Do not make them feel ganged up on by approaching in front of group. Be mindful that your frusteration may not be justified. Ask questions about big picture, ask how you can help. Don't be accusatory! 

What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?

--All PR will require sign off from someone else. We will also stop to walk full team through our overall big picture functionality when we have time (before lunch or end of day). In stand-up meeting we will discuss who will need to be communciating closely during the day. (ex: if both people are writing API routes or working with a lot of the same files)

When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?

--Workflow: try to figure it out yourself, debugging and searching online. Then slack message group for help. If still stuck for reasonable amount of time ask fellow.

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?

--We will pair when we are dealing with new technologies or when working on something and want an extra set of eyes. (Request a pair at next standup meeting).
--Norms will remain same. Each pair can decide how often to switch. 

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?

--It's okay to continue work on your own if its an issue you were already working on. Keep the group informed via Slack. "After hours" is considered voluntary. If we are feeling behind, we decide on a day to stay after together. 

What time does this group have daily stand up?

--10:45am stand up!
